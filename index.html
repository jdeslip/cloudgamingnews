            <h2>What is Cloud Gaming</h2>
             
            Cloud gaming, also known as game streaming, is a type of online gaming that allows you to play video games on remote servers and stream the game's output directly to your device. This means you can play games on a variety of devices, such as your computer, smartphone, or tablet, without needing powerful hardware.<br><br>   

            Here's how it works:<br><br>

            Remote Servers: The games are run on powerful servers in data centers.<br><br>  
            Streaming: The game's video, audio, and controls are streamed over the internet to your device.<br><br>  
            Playing: You interact with the game using your device's controls, and the game's response is streamed back to you.<br><br>

            <h3></h3>Benefits of Cloud Gaming:</h3>

            Accessibility: You can play games on a variety of devices, even less powerful ones.<br><br>
            No Downloads: You don't need to download and install games, saving storage space.<br><br>   
            Instant Access: You can start playing games instantly without long download times.<br><br>
            Game Library: Cloud gaming services often offer a large library of games to choose from.<br><br>

            <h3>Drawbacks of Cloud Gaming:</h3>
